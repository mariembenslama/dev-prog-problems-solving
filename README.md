Search Tree:
  - is Binary search tree algorithm (written in python)
  - Height  Nodes  Log calculation
      0        1      log2(1) = 0
      1        3      log2(3) = 1
      2        7      log2(7) = 2
      3       15      log2(15) = 3 
  - => log(n)
  - The search algorithm depends on the height of the tree, unless in worst case it's only one branch of the tree, it makes 
  the complexity of the algorithm O(n)
